  # Minimum caption document frequency for an entity to be kept
  # Entities appearing in fewer than min_df captions will be filtered out

  # Optional limit on number of images to process (for debugging).
  # Use null to process all images in the dataset.
  # Example: Set to 100 to process only first 100 images for quick testing

  # Output paths for entity artifacts, relative to the project root.
  # These JSON files contain the vocabulary and context mappings.

  # Verbose mode: print progress logs while building the vocabulary
